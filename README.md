# JAVASCRIPT  

## Getting started  

- Javascript is very liberal in what it allows (very less error throwing)
- Used to make webpages interactive  
- ***NodeJs***  In order to use javascript outside the browser.
- ***Raplit*** Web application for writing Javascript and many other languages online.  


## Variables in JS
- var is defined globally and can be declared again and again.
- let is defined for or between the particular block only and is prefered, can't be redeclared(throws error).  
- const neigther be redeclared nor their values can be changed.  

## Primitive datatypes
- We have 7 primitive datatypes
- ***N*** Null (empty)
- ***N*** Number (33)
- ***S*** Symbol ("Anything")
- ***S*** String ("You are a sweet person")
- ***B*** Boolean (True/False)
- ***B*** BigInt (54449)
- ***U*** undefined (=0, intialized)

## Objects or Non-Primitive data types  
- Similar to dictionaries in pyhton.
- Multiple variables can declared in the object block.
- Can look up variables using key

```javascript
const item= {
  "Gurdev":true,
  "sharn":58,
  "harsh":undefined,
  "Taish":"Chhoti Bachi Ho Kya"
}
console.log(item)
``` 
## operators
1. Arithmetic operators
   - +,-,*,/,**(exponantial),++(increament),--.
2. Com operators
   - ==,!=,<,>,===(compare datatypes even),!==,?.
